Added support for emacs within cygwin

Small changes to make this plugin work within cygwin, which doesn't have a
standard node.js implementation in it's repos but works with the standard
node.js for windows package. When emacs calls node.js without these changes, it
feeds node.js a posix/cygwin path that node doesn't recognize. The workaround is
just call the standard cygwin cli tool [cygpath
](https://cygwin.com/cygwin-ug-net/cygpath.html) from within copilot.el if
cygwin is detected.

It's possible there's a better way, or that my environment is so janky that this
is unnecessary elsewhere.

Codebase needs cleanup, holding off on official PR/draft PR for now.
