## Example Configuration

### Spacemacs + company-mode

Inside your `dotspacemacs/user-config`:

```elisp

(load-file "~/.emacs.d/copilot.el")

; complete by copilot first, then company-mode
(defun my-tab ()
  (interactive)
  (or (copilot-accept-completion)
      (company-indent-or-complete-common nil)))

; modify company-mode behaviors
(with-eval-after-load 'company
  ; disable inline previews
  (delq 'company-preview-if-just-one-frontend company-frontends)
  ; enable tab completion
  (define-key company-mode-map (kbd "<tab>") 'my-tab)
  (define-key company-active-map (kbd "<tab>") 'my-tab))

; provide completion when typing
(add-hook 'post-command-hook (lambda ()
                               (copilot-clear-overlay)
                               (when (evil-insert-state-p)
                                 (copilot-complete))))
```

### Straight

```elisp
(use-package copilot
  :straight (:host github :repo "zerolfx/copilot.el"
                   :files ("dist" "copilot.el"))
  :ensure t
  :config
  ; provide completion when typing
  (add-hook 'post-command-hook (lambda ()
                                 (copilot-clear-overlay)
                                 (when (evil-insert-state-p)
                                   (copilot-complete)))))
```

## Commands
